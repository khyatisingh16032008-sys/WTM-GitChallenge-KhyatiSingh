I am passionate about Python programming, Machine Learning, and Web Development, and I love exploring how technology can solve real-world problems.  
I am equally excited about community-building through Women Techmakers — organizing beginner-friendly workshops, mentorship programs, and events that reduce imposter syndrome.  
My interests lie in making tech inclusive, accessible, and confidence-building for women and beginners in STEM.
