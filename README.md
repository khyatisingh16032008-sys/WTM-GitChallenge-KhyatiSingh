# WTM-GitChallenge-KhyatiSingh
This repository demonstrates clean Git practices for WTM recruitment 2025-26. 
**Domain:** Women Techmakers 

**Challenge:** Low confidence among first-year women in tech  
Many first-year women entering technology face imposter syndrome and low confidence. They often feel they don’t belong in coding or STEM because of limited exposure, lack of role models, and fear of failure. This discourages them from participating in hackathons, projects, or advanced courses. 

**Proposed Initiative – Confidence Through Code**  
WTM/GDSC could organize a 4-week mentorship + mini-project program. Each participant pairs with a mentor, attends weekly coding labs, and builds small projects (like a personal webpage or chatbot). Peer-sharing circles and a final showcase help reduce imposter syndrome and boost confidence.
1. Kickoff Workshop: Icebreakers + panel with women role models.  
2. Hands-on Labs: Guided coding sessions.  
3. Confidence Circles: Peer-sharing sessions.  
4. Showcase Day: Demo projects to celebrate progress.

**Innovative Event Formats for WTM**
### Event 1: Tech Treasure Hunt – Coding Adventure  
- **Format:** Teams solve beginner-friendly coding puzzles to unlock clues in a treasure hunt.  
- **Hands-on:** Write small snippets (print text, debug errors, solve math puzzles).  
- **Community:** Teamwork ensures no one feels left behind.  
- **Impact:** Gamifies coding, reduces imposter syndrome by showing learning is collaborative and fun. Beginners gain confidence through small wins and shared excitement.  
### Event 2: Build-a-Bot Workshop – Your First Python Chatbot  
- **Format:** Guided workshop to build a simple chatbot (answer FAQs or tell jokes).  
- **Hands-on:** Step-by-step coding, pair programming, immediate testing.  
- **Community:** Students present bots, exchange ideas, and help debug.  
- **Impact:** Instant results boost confidence. Peer support reduces “I’m not good enough” feelings. Showcasing bots builds pride and belonging.  

**Beginner-Friendly 4-Week “Intro to Tech” Bootcamp Curriculum**

**Video Reflexion** 
**1. What does the speaker mean by “technology is less of a device that students possess and more of an environment that they inhabit”?**
Ans: The speaker means that technology is no longer just a physical device students own, but an environment they live in. It surrounds their learning, communication, and collaboration, shaping how they study and connect. For example, during online classes, platforms like Zoom and Google Classroom became the entire classroom itself — assignments, discussions, and friendships all happened digitally. This shows that technology is the ecosystem of education, not just a gadget.
**2. Give one real-life example from your own experience or observation that illustrates this idea.**
Ans: During my observation of first-year students in online learning, I noticed that their entire education existed inside digital platforms. For instance, instead of just “using” a laptop as a device, students lived in an environment made up of Google Classroom, Zoom, WhatsApp study groups, and GitHub.
Assignments were submitted online, discussions happened in chat groups, projects were built collaboratively on GitHub, and even friendships grew through these platforms. Technology wasn’t just a tool — it became the classroom, community, and support system all at once.
